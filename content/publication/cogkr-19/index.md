abstract: "Inferring new facts from an existing knowledge graph with explainable reasoning processes is an important problem, known as knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. The problem is often formulated as finding the specific path that represents the query relation and connects the query entity and the correct answer. However, due to the limited expressiveness of individual paths, the majority of previous works failed to capture the complex subgraph structure in the graph. We propose CogKR that traverses the knowledge graph to conduct multi-hop reasoning. More specifically, motivated by the dual process theory from cognitive science, our framework is composed of an extension module and a reasoning module. By setting up a cognitive graph through iteratively coordinating the two modules, CogKR can cope with more complex reasoning scenarios in the form of subgraphs instead of individual paths. Experiments on three knowledge graph reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CogKR achieves significant improvements in accuracy compared with previous methods while providing the explainable capacity. Moreover, we evaluate CogKR on the challenging one-shot link prediction task, exhibiting the superiority of the framework on accuracy and scalability compared to the state-of-the-art approaches."
